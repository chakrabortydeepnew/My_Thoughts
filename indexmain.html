                    <p>Hey Kritika,</p>
                    I want to share something with you that's been on my mind for a while. Spending time with you has made me realize how much I admire and care for you. Your smile, anger, your small eyes under your specs, your humbleness and mostly everything makes you truly special.
                </p>
                
                <p>
                    I feel a deep connection with you, and I’d love to take this bond to another level. If you feel the same, I’d be thrilled to explore what we could have together. If not, I completely respect your feelings, and I value our friendship no matter what.
                </p>

                <p>
                    I treasure our friendship above all else, and these feelings don't come with expectations. If they're not reciprocated, I want you to know that's perfectly okay. What matters most is the beautiful friendship we've built, and that will always remain unchanged, just like my respect and care for you.
                </p>
                <p>
                    I just wanted to be honest because you mean a lot to me.
                    Please give your genuine thought to this, and I look forward to hear your thoughts no matter what it is. I will never look back into this or will never poke you back or disturb you with this conversation.              </p>

                 <p>
                    It was my thoughts which I wanted to say since few months but I never wanted to hurt you. So thats my thing !!  </p>
